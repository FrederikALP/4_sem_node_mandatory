    <p>
        <h3>Disclaimer and preface</h3>
        This is my personal notes for the course Node.js at KEA.<br>
        Some of it may be opinionized while others may consist of mistakes as I am currently learning the concepts.<br>
        The tabs consist of the different classes and subjects that we have had so far and consists of notes from those classes/subjects.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
        Something like https://prismjs.com could be used to make syntax highlighting for the code blocks/snippets.<br>
        Also the explanations and text could most likely have been better understandable, but they are written for myself to understand.
