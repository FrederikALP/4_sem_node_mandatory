        -  Pure Data CRUDable REST API

        //REST API Conventions
//HTTP Methods and Endpoints
//Order of methods - Get, Post, Put, Patch, Delete
//Endpoint should match a specific standard, so you understand what it does just by looking at it
//collection, table should always be plural in the database and REST API
