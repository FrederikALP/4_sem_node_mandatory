        //git commands. (steps to push to a repository)
        //step 1. git add -A (adds all the files, if you use "." then it only adds the files where you are located)
        //step 2. git status (not neccessary to be done)
        //step 3. git commit -m "message"
        //step 4. git push
        // git pull to pull the repository

        - Variables.
        Let
        Const
        Var

        // "use strict";
        // strict mode, needs to be on the top level. Can also be on certain functions.
        
        // Bad practice
        // var globalVariable = "Don't do this";
        
        // Never ever do this
        // totalGlobalVariable = "is this okay?";
        
        // do not use var, const and let is new and has been added because var is deprecated
        // needs to be initialized or it will give an error(a value must be given)
        // const cannot be overwritten, but there can be added on to it, for example const tal = 1; tal + 1;
        const memeTop = "Mom: We have Javascript at home";
        // does not need to be initialized
        let memeBottom = "Javascript at home: Node.js";

    <p>
        // + is concatenation
        // , is to seperate variables(consts)
        // type coercion(interpret(change) the type)
        // javascript is an interpreted language, it tries to understand what is written (const + a number(int) becomes a string)
        // need to understand type coercion to avoid it
        // = is assignment, == is it equal but doesnt matter what datatype, === is hard equality datatype has to match

        - REST API conventions.
HTTP Methods and Endpoints
Order of methods - Get, Post, Put, Patch, Delete
Endpoint should match a specific standard, so you understand what it does just by looking at it
collection, table should always be plural in the database and REST API
